# New York State Electricity Prediction with Tensorflow and MATLAB
Remaking my undergrad capstone design with Google's Machine Learning Framework [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/). See poster [here](https://github.com/amandazhuyilan/TensorFlow-Electricity-Load-Prediction/blob/master/Yilan%20Zhu-Forecasting%20system%20of%20electricity%20load%20of%20New%20York%20State%20Poster.pdf) for more information on previous prediction done with Matlab's Neural Network Toolbox.

Electricity load data from [NYISO](http://www.nyiso.com/public/markets_operations/market_data/load_data/index.jsp).

Weather data from [Mesowest](http://mesowest.utah.edu/).
